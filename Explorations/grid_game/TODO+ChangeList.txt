1. 'MapArray' class to create, seed and hold current MapArrays.
2. 'Grids' class to create and hold all grids created from MapArray?
3. Iterator class to give cords to CraftingSeqs?

Far fetched(?):
1. 3. 'Grid' class will hold all cords it's given, and render it's own image onto each cord (Instead of having a grid object for every single grid)

1. Added inventory descriptor class, used within character.
2. Changed the class CraftingSquare class into CraftingSeq, which can now hold an entire crafting branch instead of singular items. (It can hold all axes at once, instead of making a new class for each)
